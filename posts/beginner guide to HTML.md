HTML “Hyper Text Markup Language” is popularly used on all types of website. It is not a programming language because it is a markup language.

HTML made the main structure of the webpage another language like CSS-“CASCADING STYLE SHEET”, JS-“JAVA SCRIPT”, PHP-“HYPERTEXT PRE PROCESSOR” that run, design and dynamic it.HTML is free to use you don’t have to pay for using this language. If you want to learn WEB DESIGN or WEB DEVELOPMENT you need to learn HTML, CSS, JS must. Now I’ll say about only HTML. It is very easy to learn and you don’t need much time to learn it.

You can design a webpage easily by HTML and it is supported by all browsers. The main thing is that you don’t need a compiler to run the code. You don’t need an IDE-“INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT” you can write the code in Notepad or WordPad and thee software is built in with every operating system. Just search for notepad in your computer, open it and write the code and save it. You have to save HTML file as .htm or .html extension. For see the result open the file location and open the file with any browser. You’ll find the result.

HTML is the combination of TAG .All the code in a webpage input with TAG. A TAG has three sections

1.  Opening Tag

2.  Contents of Tag

3.  Closing tag


As example <p> this is a text</p>. Here <p> is opening tag, this is a text is the content of tag and lastly </p> is closing tag. Opening tag starts a tag value and by adding closing tags it end its activity But there are many tag they don’t have any closing tag .ex-“<hr>,<br>”

An opening tag stays inside of < tag name >. And closing tag stay inside of this </ tag name >. <p> this is a text</p> -here the tag “p” inside < > here and closing tag of “p” inside of it </ >. Or if you don’t give the slash your code will break and run a wrong value. So be careful with closing a tag.

Html Attribute which give many feature to Tag. It is using inside the opening tag. Ex-<tag attribute=”value”>content</tag>. An attributes have two parts

1.  Attribute Name

2.  Attribute Value




We can use many attribute inside one tag. Ex-`<p class=”paragraph” id=”data”>this is a text</p>`. Here “P” is opening tag and “style”, “class” and ”id” is attribute name and “paragraph”, “data” is attribute name.


HTML STRUCTURE

HTML maintains a structure which defines various element like title, body etc.

Here all the tag stay inside of `<html>` and`</html>` tag. The tag <head> means heading. Here you can place <title> tag CSS, JS code link, Meta tags and Link tags. The <body> tags define the main body or the main part of code. We can place here text, audio, video graphics etc. And you have to close all the tag before saving it and save it with any name with .htm or .html extension. Then run it.

Write this code on notepad and execute it

`<html><head><title>This is title</title></head><body><p>This is a paragraph</p></body></html>`

After run the code
